# implicit-layers

Small tutorial that was used for the SDSC internal presentation on implicit layers. The repository contains 2 notebooks
- one studies the implementation of a convex layer within a FF NN. The model is applied to Swissgrid data.
- the other one studies the implementation of a projection layer over the latent space of an Auto-Encoder model.
